# Slave

A multiplayer **Daifugō** ("Slave" / President) card game. Create a room, share
the six-character code, and play 3–6 handed in the browser. Disconnecting never
costs you your seat: while a match is running you can close the tab, come back,
and your hand is still there.

```bash
bun install
bun dev          # web on :3000, game server on :3001
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, create a room, and either share the invite link or
fill the empty seats with bots.

## Layout

| Package | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/game` | The rules engine. Pure functions, no I/O, 99 unit tests. |
| `packages/shared` | The wire contract: Zod message schemas, error codes, and the redaction that turns authoritative state into one player's view. |
| `apps/server` | Elysia on Bun. HTTP for room lifecycle, WebSocket for play. |
| `apps/web` | Next.js 16 App Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui on Radix, Motion. |

The rules engine knows nothing about sockets and the socket layer knows nothing
about React, which is why the whole game can be tested without a browser.

## Commands

```bash
bun dev          # both apps
bun run build    # production build of the web app
bun test         # rules engine (Vitest) + server integration (bun test)
bun run check    # Biome lint + format
bun run typecheck
```

`bun test` runs 99 engine tests plus 11 integration tests that drive real
WebSocket clients through a full round, a mid-game disconnect and reconnect, a
forged-token attempt, and a bot-only game.

## Rules

Standard Daifugō on a plain **52-card deck — no jokers**.

- Ranks run `3 < 4 < … < K < A < 2`.
- A play is **1–4 cards of one rank**: single, pair, triple, or quad. You must
  answer with the same shape at a higher rank.
- **Passing locks you out** of the current trick. When everyone but the last
  player to play has passed, the trick clears and that player leads.
- The **♦3 holder** leads the first trick of round one. After that the **Slave**
  leads, which is their compensation for the tribute.
- First out is **President**, last is **Slave**. Points are
  `playerCount − position`, so in a four-player game: 3 / 2 / 1 / 0.

### Between rounds — the tribute

The Slave's **two strongest cards are taken automatically** — that is the whole
point of being the Slave — and the President chooses **any two** to send back.
At five or more players the Vice pair swaps one card on the same terms;
Citizens exchange nothing. If the President stalls, their two weakest cards go
automatically after 30 seconds, so a match can never deadlock behind one idle
player.

### Room settings

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-cut | on | Any play containing an 8 ends the trick immediately; the cutter leads next. |
| Revolution | on | A four-of-a-kind inverts the rank order for the rest of the round. A second quad flips it back. |
| Turn timer | 30s | 15 / 30 / 60 / off. On expiry you auto-pass, or shed your lowest card if you were leading. |
| Rounds | 5 | 3 / 5 / 10, or endless until the host ends it. |

## How the multiplayer works

- **Server-authoritative.** Clients send intents; the server runs them through
  the rules engine and pushes back a fresh snapshot. Nothing is optimistic.
- **Redacted snapshots.** Every player receives their own view, in which other
  hands are card *counts*. Other players' cards never travel over the wire, so
  there is nothing to read in devtools.
- **Reconnect is just a snapshot.** Joining, refreshing, and reconnecting all
  take the identical code path, which is why reconnection is hard to break.
- **Seat tokens are HMAC-signed** (`playerId.roomCode.signature`) and stored in
  `localStorage`. A token from one room will not open a seat in another.
- **Seats are held for the whole match.** A disconnected player auto-passes so
  play continues, and reclaims their hand whenever they return. Bots never take
  over a human's seat.
- **The host role migrates** to the longest-connected player, so a vanished host
  cannot stall the table.
- Rooms live in memory behind a `RoomStore` interface and are collected ten
  minutes after the last player disconnects. Swapping in Redis is one
  implementation of that interface.

## Sound

Every effect is **synthesised in the browser** with the Web Audio API — there
are no audio files to download or license. The audio context is created on your
first click (browsers require a gesture), and mute plus volume persist locally.

## Configuration

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001/ws

# apps/server
PORT=3001
SESSION_SECRET=change-me-in-production   # signs seat tokens
```

The web app can be deployed anywhere; the game server needs a **long-running
process** (Fly, Railway, a VPS) because it holds WebSockets and in-memory rooms.
It will not work on a serverless target.
